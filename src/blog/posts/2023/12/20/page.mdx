# Happy New Year!

This was quite the busy past year for us in the Rubernelius household. We survived a record Mammoth winter, spent nearly a month travelling in Japan, made major progress on our off-grid ambitions, and most importantly welcomed a very special new arrival.

<br/>

## Surviving Winter

We knew moving to Mammoth that it could really snow. Sarah's entire interview experience was one continuous whiteout here back in 2019 - she had to take it on faith that there were even mountains in the area after my repeated reassurances.

<br/>

Of course, after we moved in 2019 California had its three driest consecutive years on record, so we had spent a lot of time wishing it would actually snow more. But nothing could have prepared us (or anyone else) for the record wet year of 22/23
